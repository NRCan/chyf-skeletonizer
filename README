Skeletonizer Version 1.0.0

This document contains a quick guide to get you started using the Skeltonizer utility. For
more complete documentation (background, techical info, etc) see the Skeletonizer User 
Guide located in the doc directory of the installation.

Installation:

The skeletonizer can be run in any 1 of 2 ways.

1. From the command line.
2. As an extension to a preexisting JUMP workbench installation.


1. In the root directory of the skeletonizer installation are a number of scripts for 
   running utility from the command line.
   
   
   skeletonizer.bat	(batch mode windows platforms)
   skeletonizer.sh  (batch mode unix platforms)
   skeletonizer_gui.bat (gui mode windows platforms)
   skeletonizer_gui.sh  (gui mode unix platforms)
   
   The batch mode scripts take 5 arguments:
   
   1. Path to the point input shape file.
   2. Path to the polygon input shape file.
   3. Path to the skeleton output shape file.
   4. Path to the report output text file.
   5. Path to the bad polygon output shape file.
   
   The gui mode scripts do not take any arguments and will start the JUMP workbench 
   upon invocation.
   
2. The relevant files are:
   
   The extension jar itself: 
   
   <skeletonizer root>/lib/skeletonizer.jar
   
   And the support libraries:
   
   <skeletonizer root>/lib/graph.jar
   <skeletonizer root>/lib/network.jar
   <skeletonizer root>/lib/utilities.jar

   All the above files should be copied into the extension directory of your JUMP 
   installation. See JUMP user guide for more information.
   
   Note: This version of the skeletonizer was built and tested against JUMP 1.1.2.
